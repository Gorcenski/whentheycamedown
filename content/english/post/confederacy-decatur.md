A 30-foot obelisk Confederate monument, which had stood for 112 years, was taken down in the downtown Decatur square in response to a judge's order.

<!--more-->

After many incidents of vandalism and citing safety concerns for its potential removal by the people, DeKalb County judge Clarence Seeliger ordered the monument removed.[^1] In the prior year, the monument had been subject to legislative debate, wherein the State of Georgia increased penalties for vandalizing statues and restricted the ability to "recontextualize" them.[^2] A decision was made to install a plaque adding context to the obelisk, referencing its installation by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.[^3]

Local officials voted to remove the monument in 2018, one of the many monuments nationwide which received additional scrutiny following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.[^4] Local activists with [Hate Free Decatur](https://www.facebook.com/HateFreeDecatur/) have long been advocating for its removal.
