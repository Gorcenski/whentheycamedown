The Farmville Town Council voted unanimously at its continued council meeting on June 18, 2020 to remove the Confederate statue located at the intersection of High and Randolph streets in Farmville, VA, U.S.A.[^1]. The continued meeting was scheduled to begin at 7pm; the removal of the statue with a crane was underway by 7:30pm [^1]. A local newspaper reported that the audience for the removal consisted of "police officers, town council members and a crowd of around 50 onlookers"[^1]. “The statue will be secured off-site and preserved until further conversation with various community groups and the citizens of Farmville about its relocation and the appropriate disposition of the monument base,” officials stated in a press release[^1]. The statue consisted of a seven-foot-tall bronze soldier at the top of the 19-foot pedestal made of Virginia gray granite; only the statue portion was removed by truck, leaving the pedestal in place[^1]. 

The statue was put into place in October of 1900 by Confederate Veterans and Daughters of the Confederacy at a cost of $3,000, on property owned by the town, in front of the Farmville United Methodist Church and across from Longwood University[^1].

Items memorializing the statue's racist history were added by unknown persons to the empty pedestal after the statue's removal, but these items had been removed by the following Saturday morning (June 20, 2020)[^2]. The town manager stated that the town did not remove the items, and that the police and commonwealth attorney decided "there is no crime in taking items that were left on public property and not belonging to the town”[^2].
