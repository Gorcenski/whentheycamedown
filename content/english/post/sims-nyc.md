A statue to the gynecologist James Marion Sims was removed from Central Park after city action responded to public outrage.

<!--more-->

The New York City Public Design Commission voted to remove the statue of J. Marion Sims after it stood for 124 years.[^1] Sims was known as the "father of modern gynecology," but evidence shows that he routinely experimented on enslaved Black women.[^2] Some of those women are known to history as Lucy, Anarcha, and Betsey.[^3]

Protests for the statue's removal had been ongoing for at least eight years,[^4] but the fight did not end there. In 2019, community members[^5] continued to express outrage at the proposed replacement.[^6] The Sims statue was relocated to Sims grave and recontextualized with a plaque highlighting his unethical medical practices.[^7]
