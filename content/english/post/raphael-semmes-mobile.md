A statue of Confederate Admiral Raphael Semmes was removed in Mobile, Alabama by order of Mayor Sandy Stimpson

<!--more-->

After being vandalized during a protest the week of June th, it was removed overnight without any public notice. The mayor revealed via a Twitter
thread[^1] that he had ordered the removal, saying "Moving this statue will not change the past. It is about removing a potential distraction so we may focus clearly on the future of our city"

Semmes was an Admiral in the Confederate Navy who sunk Union-allied commerce ships during the Civil War. After the war, he became a "Lost Cause"
advocate, aiding in the rewriting of history as to the real reason for the Civil War.
