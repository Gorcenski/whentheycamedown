Protestors on the campus of UNC at Chapel Hill pulled down the Confederate monument commonly known as "Silent Sam." 

<!--more-->

In 1913 the "Confederate Monument," representing an unnamed Confederate soldier, was unveiled on the campus of UNC at Chapel Hill by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.[^1] At the unveiling, Julian Carr, a prominent industrialist and supporter of the Ku Klux Klan, gave a "lengthy address" in support of white supremacy and told a story in which boasted of brutally beating a black woman.[^2]

In April 2018, Maya Little, then a doctoral student at UNC, poured red ink and her own blood on the statue, "adding historical context to the white supremacist monument."[^3] During her action, another student read from a transcript of Carr's speech.[^4] Little was arrested and faced charges of property destruction. The judge in her trial withheld the verdict under a "continued judgment," and she faced no sentence.[^5]

Protestors held a rally on 20 August 2018 in support of Little and in opposition to the university's refusal to remove the statue. Shortly after 9pm, a group of protestors pulled the statue to the ground.[^6]
