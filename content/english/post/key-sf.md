The Slaveowner and author of the "Star Spangled Banner" was torn from his perch by direct action on Juneteenth 2020.

<!--more-->

Best known for writing the American national anthem, "The Star Spangled Banner," a song with racist lyrics[^1], Francis Scott Key was an unrepentant slaveowner.[^2] A statue of Key in Golden Gate Park was upended by protesters and the base vandalized during Juneteenth protests in 2020.[^3] The statue's removal comes after years of efforts by locals to remove local references to racists and slaveowners, including a local school.[^4]

Key was one of three statues toppled in Golden Gate Park on Juneteeth 2020; the others were [Junípero Serra](../serra-sf/) and [Ulysses S. Grant](../grant-sf).
