Christopher Columbus was beheaded in Boston, Massachusetts, before being removed by the city.

<!--more-->

The statue of Christopher Columbus in Boston's North End was beheaded by an unknown party during the Uprising of 2020.[^1] A day before, the Columbus statue in Richmond, Virginia was toppled and removed to a lake. After the beheading, the city opted to remove the statue to prevent further vandalism.[^2]

This was not the first time the Columbus statue was vandalized. In 2015, the statue was painted red and the base was adorned with the words, "Black Lives Matter."[^3] In 2002 and 2006, the statue was beheaded, and it was vandalized with paint several times during the 2000s.[^4]

Christopher Columbus played an instrumental role in, among other crimes, the genocide of the Taíno and Arawak people.[^5]
