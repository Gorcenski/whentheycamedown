A monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee was removed by city action in early 2017.

<!--more-->

In 2014, noted Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis convinced[^1] New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu to consider removing the Robert E. Lee statue. In December 2015, this led to a city council vote[^2] to remove the statue and three other Confederate statues.

After legal battles, attempted blocking legislation, public comment, and even a public opposition from Governor Bobby Jindal, the statues were finally removed[^3] in May 2017.
