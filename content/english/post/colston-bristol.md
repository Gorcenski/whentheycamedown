The statue of the prolific slave trader who was enriched by selling over 80,000 enslaved people was torn down by the people during the Uprising of 2020.[^1] [^2]

The statue, which had previously been "recontextualized,"[^3] was torn down and rolled to the nearby harbor of the river Avon, and unceremoniously pitched therein.[^4]
