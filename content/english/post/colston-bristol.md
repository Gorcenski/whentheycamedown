The statue of the [prolific slave trader](https://counteringcolston.wordpress.com/who-was-edward-colston-2/) who was enriched by [selling over 80,000 enslaved people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Colston) was torn down by the people during the Uprising of 2020.

The statue, which had previously been ["recontextualized,"](http://web.archive.org/web/20190330033857/https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/wording-second-plaque-proposed-edward-1810137) was torn down and rolled to the nearby harbor of the river Avon, and [unceremoniously pitched therein.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/protesters-throw-slavers-statue-bristol-harbor-make-waves-across-britain-180975060/)
