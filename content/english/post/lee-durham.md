A statue Confederate General Robert E. Lee was removed from Duke University's Chapel after being damaged in the week following Unite the Right.

<!--more-->

In the days following the fatal Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the face of the Robert E. Lee statue adorning the Duke University Chapel was damaged.[^1] Days later, the statue was removed at the request of university administration.[^2]  State law prohibited the removal of similar statues on public land, but Duke University is a private institution and so the law did not apply.

A few days before the Lee statue was removed, a Confederate soldier memorial [was torn down](../udc-durham) in Durham during a protest.
