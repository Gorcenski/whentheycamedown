Ulysses S. Grant was the last US President to have owned an enslaved human being, a man named William Jones.[^1] Grant was the Commanding General of Union forces during the American Civil War, and was later elected president. However, nevertheless, he held Jones as a slave until shortly before secession began, freeing in in 1859.

Protesters toppled his bust during the Juneteenth protests in Golden Gate Park in 2020 and dragged the object down the street.[^2]

Grant was one of three statues toppled in Golden Gate Park on Juneteeth 2020; the others were [Francis Scott Key](../key-sf/) and [Junípero Serra](../serra-sf).
