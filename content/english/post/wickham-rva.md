Williams Carter Wickham was toppled in Richmond, Virginia.

<!--more-->

The statue of the [Confederate general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Carter_Wickham) was torn down by the people during the Uprising of 2020.

[The statue, formerly of Monroe Park](https://abc13.com/christopher-columbus-statue-torn-down-murderer-real-story/6240352/), was toppled by the people after authorities ignored [earlier pleas by his descendants](https://www.richmond.com/news/local/confederate-descendants-ask-richmond-mayor-to-remove-statue-from-monroe-park/article_3b313c75-c6f9-5273-8842-00944669f305.html) to remove the statue.
