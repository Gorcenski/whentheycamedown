Williams Carter Wickham was toppled in Richmond, Virginia.

<!--more-->

The statue of the Confederate general was torn down by the people during the Uprising of 2020.[^1]

The statue, formerly of Monroe Park,[^2] was toppled by the people after authorities ignored earlier pleas by his descendants to remove the statue.[^3]
