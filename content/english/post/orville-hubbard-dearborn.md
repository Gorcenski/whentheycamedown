A statue of former Mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, Orville L. Hubbard, was removed by family in response to a planned rally.

<!--more-->

Hubbard was the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan from 1942 to 1978, serving a total of 36 years. 

Hubbard openly held racist views and proposed many segregationalist policies. Hubbard was notably tried for conspiracy to violate human rights[^2] by allowing Dearborn police to stand by while a crowd stoned a home that was incorrectly believed to have sold property to a Black family. After Hubbard was acquitted, he treated the jury to a steak dinner[^3]. 

His slogan, "Keep Dearborn White" was a catch phrase meaning "Keep Dearborn White.[^4]"

In June 2020, a rally was planned at the statue in response to the protests over the death of George Floyd. Two days prior to the rally, the statue was removed by remaining family.
