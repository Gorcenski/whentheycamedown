The generic confederate statue of an infantryman was removed from Hemming Park ahead of a planned protest.[^1] The statue was removed by the city.

The mayor says that remaining Confederate memorials in the city, of which 10 remain, will also be removed.[^2] This action came during the Uprising in 2020.
