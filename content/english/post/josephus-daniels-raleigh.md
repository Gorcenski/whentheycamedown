<!--more-->

Josephus Daniels, newspaper editor and publisher to Raleigh's _News and Observer_ and former Secretary to the Navy was a white supremacist and leading perpetrator to the 1898 Wilmington insurrection/massacre/coup.

Daniels used his highly influential newspaper to propagandize against Black political power. He and others planned and conspired the 1989 "race riots" to overthrow a legitimately elected government. Daniels ran “race-baiting editorials and newspaper cartoons and sensational, fabricated news stories” to generate fear and anger toward Black people[^1].

On November 10, 1989, the Wilmington insurrection of 1989 happened where white supremacists murdered 60+ people, destroyed Black businesses, and replaced elected government officials. The event was originally described as a race riot caused by Black people but was discovered to be a coup d'état by white supremacists[^3]. The Wilmington insurrection marked a start to the Jim Crow era.

For decades, the perpetrators were casted as heroes and the history was misrepresented until roughly 1998. In 2000, a report on the event was was commissioned by the North Carolina state legislature. In 2006, the 500+ page report was completed and identified Josephus Daniels as a direct perpetrator of the insurrection[^2].

Family members of Daniels' removed the statue from Raleigh's Nash Square on the morning of June 16, 2020 noting that the statue undermines efforts for equality.
