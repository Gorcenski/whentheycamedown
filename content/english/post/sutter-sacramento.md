A statue of John Sutter was removed from the campus of Sutter General Hospital / Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento, CA, days after it was marked with red paint by protesters.

<!--more-->

The statue was donated to the hospital system in 1987 by a Swiss-American group after it was refused by Sutter's Fort State Historic Park.

Sutter enslaved hundreds of Native Americans from 1839 - 1849 and participated in the genocide of indigenous peoples in California.
