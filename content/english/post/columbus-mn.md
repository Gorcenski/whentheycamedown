Christopher Columbus was toppled in St. Paul, Minnesota.

<!--more-->

The St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A. statue of the colonizer[^1] responsible for the genocide[^2] of Indigenous people was torn down[^3] by members of the American Indian Movement during the Uprising of 2020.

The statue, formerly in front of the State Capitol building, was easily upended.[^4] This followed failed attempts to remove the statue through more lawful channels, according to demonstrators.[^5]
