Self-described anti-fascists beheaded the statue of Nazi collaborator Seán Russell in Dublin.

<!--more-->

Russell was a senior member and chief of staff of the IRA who died on board a German Kriegsmarine U-Boat in 1940.[^1] A statue of him was erected in Fairview Park in Dublin, Ireland.[^2] The statue has been subject to many attacks: in May 1952, paint was smeared on the statue; in 2004, it was beheaded on New Years Eve 2004 by a self-described ‘Anti-Nazi’ group.[^3]

The statue was replaced, but during the Uprising in 2020 talk of removing it has begun anew.[^4]
