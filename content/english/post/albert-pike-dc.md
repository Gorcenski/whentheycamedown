A statue of Albert Pike, the only outdoor monument to a Confederate officer in Washington, D.C., was toppled by protesters on Juneteenth of 2020.[^1]

Albert Pike served as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. He was also an influential Freemason. The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry commisioned the statue in 1901. The D.C. government had previously made plans to remove the statue after the events of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA, but had no jursidiction over the statue which was on land owned by the National Park Service.[^2]
