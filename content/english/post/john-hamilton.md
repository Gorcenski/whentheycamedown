A statue of British naval officer John Fane Charles Hamilton was removed by the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, at the request of local Maori.

<!--more-->

Hamilton, accused of killing Maori people in the 1860s,[^1] is commemorated both by the city's name and by this statue, which a local company gifted to the city in 2013.[^2] The statue was removed by the city at the request of the Waikato-Tainui people after Maori elder Taitimu Maipi said he intended to personally tear it down.
