Workers removed a statue of Jefferson Davis from the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort.

<!--more-->

Jefferson Davis was the President of the Confederate States during the US Civil War and owned as many as 113 enslaved people.[^1] A 15' tall marble statue of Davis was erected in the Kentucky State Capitol under the sponsorship of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and was first unveiled 10 Dec 1936.[^2]

The Historic Properties Advisory Commission met Friday 12 June at the request of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and voted 11–1 in favour of the statue's removal. The next day, workers removed the statue. It is expected that the statue will be relocated to the Jefferson Davis Historic Site, where Davis was born.[^3]
