A bust of former Belgian King Leopold II in Audergham, a municipality of Brussels in Belgium, was splashed with red paint and pulled from its pedestal.

King Leopold II colonized the Congo in the mid-1880s and ran a brutal regime involving slavery, resource exploitation, and genocide, which lasted until 1960 and left an estimated 10-15 million dead.  [^1][^2]

It is unknown exactly who pulled down the statue in the night of 12th June 2020 but some reports say there was a group of approximately 10 people, who had disappeared by the time the police arrived. [^3] Images on Twitter  appear to show the bust being removed from its pedestal.[^4]  

Other statues of King Leopold II have also been pulled down. For example one in [Antwerp](https://whentheycamedown.com/post/leopold-ii-antwerp/).
