Christopher Columbus was removed in Chula Vista, CA, hours before a planned protest in favor of its removal.

<!--more-->

The statue of Christopher Columbus in Chula Vista's Discovery Park was removed to storage before a planned protest.[^1] The city's action was out of concern for public safety.[^2]

The statue had been the target of vandalism on prior occasions, including on "Columbus Day" in 2019[^3] and in February of that same year.[^4]

Christopher Columbus played an instrumental role in, among other crimes, the genocide of the Taíno and Arawak people.[^5]
