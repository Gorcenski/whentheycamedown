A statue to the former Philadelphia Police Commissioner was removed by city action in Philadelphia, PA

<!--more-->

After protests and vandalism of the statue during the Uprising of 2020, the city removed the statue of Frank Rizzo across from Philadelphia City Hall.[^1] Discussions to remove the statue date back at least to 2016,[^2] when the activist group [Philly for R.E.A.L. Justice](http://phillyrealjustice.com/missionstatement) created the hashtag #FrankRizzoDown. In 2017 it was announced that the city would move the statue.[^3] Yet in mid-2020, the statue remained. The sculptor of the statue, Zenos Frudakis, supported its removal.[^4]

Frank Rizzo was a noted racist who once told Philadelphians to "vote white."[^5] He openly disdained minority communities in Philadelpha.[^6]
