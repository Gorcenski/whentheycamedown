The statue depicting the Texas Ranger Captain Jay Banks[^1], titled "One Riot, One Ranger" has been removed from Dallas Love Field Airport by the City of Dallas[^2].

<!--more-->

The city was prompted to remove the statue after receiving an excerpt from a book that will be published soon about the Texas Rangers, titled "Cult of Glory"[^3].  It was donated to the city in 1963, and has been now placed in storage.
