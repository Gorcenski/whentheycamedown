In 2014, noted Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis [convinced](https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_9971d9c6-6a68-51da-9343-67c7d0ab9b3b.html) New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu to consider removing the Robert E. Lee statue. In December 2015, this led to [a city council vote](https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_abfc7015-39f1-5b43-90f7-819af1623a38.html) to remove the statue and three other Confederate statues.

After legal battles, attempted blocking legislation, public comment, and even a public opposition from Governor Bobby Jindal, [the statues were finally removed](https://www.nola.com/news/article_ea7f25d7-ddab-58b4-b168-38965e9129e6.html) in May 2017.
