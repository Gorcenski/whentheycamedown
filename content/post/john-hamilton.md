Hamilton, [accused of killing Maori people in the 1860s](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/john-hamilton-statue-new-zealand-colonialism-britain-maori-a9562296.html), is commemorated both by the city's name and by this statue, which a local company [gifted to the city in 2013](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/12/statue-british-naval-captain-john-hamilton-taken-down-new-zealand-video). The statue was removed by the city at the request of the Waikato-Tainui people after Maori elder Taitimu Maipi said he intended to personally tear it down.
