A 1990s statue of 16th century Spanish colonizer Juan de O&ntilde;ante was removed by Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, prior to a planned protest by activists who had long decried the statue's presence.

O&ntilde;ante, who reached what is now New Mexico in 1598, is [seen as a founding figure among some local descendants of Spanish settlers](https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/activists-take-aim-at-statues-of-spanish-conqueror-juan-de-o-ate/article_80575c3a-44ec-58f2-8d56-521f64ba542e.html) but is known to the indigenous community for enslaving indigenous and mixed-ancestry servants and for ordering the removal of the right feet of 24 captives after his soldiers' attack on Acoma Pueblo. An unknown person cut off the O&ntilde;ante statue's right foot in 1998.

County workers [removed the O&ntilde;ante statue](https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/work-crews-take-down-o-ate-statue/article_41428204-af3c-11ea-b12b-c33ed0b5b099.html) on the morning of June 15, 2020, a few hours before a 1 p.m. protest at the site of the statue outside the O&ntilde;ante Monument Resource and Visitors Center. According to witnesses, county manager Tomas Campos said that the monument was being removed to protect it.
