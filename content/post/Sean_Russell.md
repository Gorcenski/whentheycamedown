Self-described anti-fascists beheaded the statue of Nazi collaborator Seán Russell in Dublin.

<!--more-->

Russell was [a senior member and chief of staff of the IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se%C3%A1n_Russell) who died on board a German Kriegsmarine U-Boat in 1940. A statue of him was [erected in Fairview Park](https://comeheretome.com/2012/04/20/statues-of-dublin-sean-russell-fairview-park/) in Dublin, Ireland. The statue has been subject to [many attacks](https://www.thejournal.ie/sean-russell-statue-3549072-Aug2017/): in May 1952, paint was smeared on the statue; in 2004, it was beheaded on New Years Eve 2004 by a self-described ‘Anti-Nazi’ group.

The statue was replaced, but during the Uprising in 2020 [talk of removing](https://www.irishnews.com/news/republicofirelandnews/2020/06/10/news/dublin-statue-of-nazi-collaborator-sean-russell-may-have-to-be-removed-leo-varadkar-says-1969856/) it has begun anew.
