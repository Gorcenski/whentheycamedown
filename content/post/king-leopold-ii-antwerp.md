A statue of King Leopold II was torched by protestors, then removed by the city in Antwerp, Belgium.

<!--more-->

King Leopold II colonized the Congo in the mid-1880s and ran a brutal regime involving slavery, ecocidal resource extraction, and genocide, which lasted until 1960 and left an estimated 10 million dead[^1]. The night of June 3, 2020, protestors set the statue on fire as part of international 2020 Black liberation protests[^2]. Subsequently, on June 9th, the city government removed the statue, placing it in the Middelheim museum where it will remain "for the time being." An aide to the conservative mayor of Antwerp, Bart De Wever, communicated that the statue was removed because it posed a "public safety issue," and not because of public outcry. He added that the square where it stood was set to be redesignd in 2023, "probably without space for the statue[^3]."
